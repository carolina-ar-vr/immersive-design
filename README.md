# [Intro to XR and Immersive Design Workshop](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9Gsls4E0/9CNn6o1Oj7PtVaTisZNbSQ/view?utm_content=DAF9Gsls4E0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)
A Carolina AR/VR workshop all about immersive design – created by Ashley Neall!

## An Introduction
This workshop introduces students to extended reality (XR) and how to approach designing immersive experiences for all **sensory domains** within XR _(i.e. **visual**, **aural**, **haptic**, **olfactory**, and **gustatory**)_. We begin with a conceptual overview of what XR is and the spectrum from VR <-> MR <-> AR; then we move into explaining each sensory domain and roles that are crucial to immersive design. We will cover a range of interfaces (e.g. HMDs, 3D displays, wearable tech), 3D UI/UX, storytelling, modeling/animation, sound and haptic design, gustatory and olfactory displays! 

### Experience Immersion
The hands-on aspect of this workshop involves every workshop attendee experiencing the immersion provided through visual, aural, and haptic design. After a presentation introducing all the sensory domains, we will have two stations:
  2. Visual + Aural: Quest 3 – _experience a MR application on the Quest 3, incorporating stereoscopic 3D graphics and spatial audio_
  3. Haptic: bHaptics TactSuitX40 – _experience haptic feedback and design your own tactile demo with bHaptics' studio_

While we can't provide hardware for olfactory and gustatory displays in this workshop, we will delve into an experiment that exposes students to the complexity of our tongue and nose's receptor cells:

### Olfactory + Gustatory Experiment


## Pre-Workshop Setup
Please make sure to complete the following steps *before* attending the workshop, as you will not have time during the workshop:
1. Create a Unity account. [Follow this link](https://glitch.com/). _we also suggest activating a **free** Educational License_
3. Bookmark this repository (as you will be using its 3D assets and code during and after the workshop).
4. Read [this page](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/).
5. (Optional) Explore A-Frame Docs to get ahead!

## Workshop Outline
Since this workshop only lasts for an hour, this will help gauge what we will spend our time on:
1. [Intro to XR and Immersive Design presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9Gsls4E0/9CNn6o1Oj7PtVaTisZNbSQ/view?utm_content=DAF9Gsls4E0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor) – 20 minutes
2. Olfactory + Gustatory Experiment – 10 minutes
   * Steps coming soon
4. Sensory Stations - 25 minutes
   * Visual – Blender
   * Visual + Aural – Quest 3
   * Haptic – bHaptics
5. Questions + Upcoming Events - 5 minutes
   * Post-workshop resources
   * Upcoming Events
   * Join our Discord


## Post-Workshop Feedback and Resources
* Finalized repository (will post after the workshop)
* At the conclusion of this workshop, we encourage students to read the extra slides and explore linked resources as they ideate XR projects to work on this semester and in future semesters :) Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, and if this workshop has sparked an interest in XR and graphics, consider [joining Carolina AR/VR](https://linktr.ee/carvr)!
