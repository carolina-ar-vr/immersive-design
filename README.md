# [Intro to XR and Immersive Design Workshop](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF9Gsls4E0/9CNn6o1Oj7PtVaTisZNbSQ/view?utm_content=DAF9Gsls4E0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)
A Carolina AR/VR workshop all about immersive design – created by Ashley Neall and Grace Fei.

## An Introduction
This workshop introduces students to extended reality (XR) and how to approach designing immersive experiences for all **sensory domains** within XR _(i.e. **visual**, **aural**, **haptic**, **olfactory**, and **gustatory**)_. We begin with a conceptual overview of what XR is and the spectrum from VR <-> MR <-> AR; then we move into explaining each sensory domain and roles that are crucial to immersive design. We will cover a range of interfaces (e.g. HMDs, 3D displays, wearable tech), 3D UI/UX, storytelling, modeling/animation, sound and haptic design, gustatory and olfactory displays! 

### Experience Immersion
The hands-on aspect of this workshop involves every workshop attendee experiencing the immersion provided through visual, aural, and haptic design. After a presentation introducing all the sensory domains, we will have two stations:
  2. Visual + Aural: Quest 3 – _experience a MR application on the Quest 3, incorporating stereoscopic 3D graphics and spatial audio_
  3. Haptic: bHaptics TactSuitX40 – _experience haptic feedback and design your own tactile demo with bHaptics' studio_

While we can't provide hardware for olfactory and gustatory displays in this workshop, we will delve into an experiment that exposes students to the complexity of our tongue and nose's receptor cells:

### Olfactory + Gustatory Experiment
[more info coming on thursday]

## Pre-Workshop Setup
Please make sure to complete the following steps *before* attending the workshop, as you will not have time during the workshop. Don't worry, everything is free:
### General Setup
1. Bookmark this repository (as you will be using its assets during _and_ after our workshop)!
2. Follow the [**Unity Setup**](https://github.com/carolina-ar-vr/immersive-design/blob/main/README.md#unity-setup) below.
3. Follow the [**Blender Setup**](https://github.com/carolina-ar-vr/immersive-design/blob/main/README.md#blender-setup) below. 
4. Read these articles on: [olfactory displays](https://venturebeat.com/game-development/aromajoin-unveils-scent-based-xr-devices-at-ces-2024/) and gustatory displays with food [textures](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2971763.2971792) and [tastes](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/12/10/250001919/the-digital-lollipop-you-can-literally-taste-the-innovation).
5. (Optional) Watch this tutorial to [design haptic experiences with bHaptics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyq9GHdchzc).
6. (Optional) Watch this tutorial to [add spatial audio in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNpNuDKSmgE&t=618s).

### Unity Setup
1. [Create a **Unity account**](https://id.unity.com/en/conversations/6d52083b-3d3a-4285-a1c5-ecb2119170d1001f). _Although it's not required, we also suggest activating a **free** [Student License](https://unity.com/products/unity-student), which basically gives you Unity Pro for free as a student!_
2. Download the [**Unity Hub**](https://unity.com/download); _this is the hub where you will be able to access your projects and install different modules_.
3. Install the latest **Unity Editor** LTS version _(as of February 2024, we suggest version **2022.3.20f1**)_
  a. When selecting the modules to install along with the Editor, make sure to also check off the following modules:
    * Visual Studio – _this is for your IDE, so that you can program interactions later!_
    * Android Build Support – _this includes modules needed to develop XR experiences for Android-based platforms (e.g. Quest 3, Quest Pro)_
### Blender Setup
1. [Download Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/).
2. Watch [this tutorial](https://youtube.com/shorts/5jTSx0Teo7c?si=FPazp8UI7_KD9KFX) that will show you how to **3D model an apple in Blender**.
3. Save your Blender project as a .blend file _(Navigate to File -> **Save As** within Blender)_.
4. Come prepared with you **laptop**, **mouse**, and **.blend file** on Thursday!

## Workshop Outline

   * Post-workshop resources
   * Upcoming Events
   * Join our Discord


## Post-Workshop Feedback and Resources
* Finalized repository (will post after the workshop)
* Post-workshop resources (will post after the workshop)
* At the conclusion of this workshop, we encourage students to read the extra slides and explore linked resources as they ideate XR projects to work on this semester and in future semesters :) Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, and if this workshop has sparked an interest in XR and graphics, consider [joining Carolina AR/VR](https://linktr.ee/carvr)!
